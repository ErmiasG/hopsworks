# Configure Kerberos

Kerberos need some server configuration before you can enable it from the UI. For instruction on how to 
configure your hopsworks server see 
[Server Configuration for Kerberos](./configure-server.md#server-configuration-for-kerberos) 

After configuring the server you can configure Authentication methods by clicking on your name in the top right
corner of the navigation bar and choosing *Cluster Settings* from the dropdown menu.
In the **Cluster Settings** _Authentication_ tab you can enable Kerberos by clicking on the Kerberos checkbox.

If LDAP/Kerberos checkbox is not checked make sure that you configured your application server and enable it by
clicking on the checkbox.

- Account status: the status a user will be assigned when lodging in for the first time. If a use is assigned a status
  different from _Activated_ an admin needs to manually activate each user from the [User management](../user.md).
- Group mapping: allows you to specify a mapping between LDAP groups and Hopsworks groups. The mapping is a
  semicolon separated string in the form ```Directory Administrators->HOPS_ADMIN;IT People-> HOPS_USER```. Default 
  is empty. If no mapping is specified, users need to be assigned a role by an admin before they can log in.
- User id: the id field in LDAP with a string placeholder. Default ```uid=%s```.
- User given name: the given name field in LDAP. Default ```givenName```.
- User surname: the surname field in LDAP. Default ```sn```.
- User email: the email field in LDAP. Default ```mail```.
- User search filter: the search filter for user. Default ```uid=%s```.
- Principal search filter: the search filter for principal name. Default ```krbPrincipalName=%s```.
- Group search filter: the search filter for groups. Default ```member=%d```.
- Group target: the target to search for groups in the LDAP directory tree. Default ```cn```.
- Dynamic group target: the target to search for dynamic groups in the LDAP directory tree. Default ```memberOf```.
- User dn: specify the distinguished name (DN) of the container or base point where the users are stored. Default is
  empty.

All defaults are taken from OpenLDAP.
