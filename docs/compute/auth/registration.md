# Register a New Account on Hopsworks

The process for registering a new account is as follows:

1. Register your email address and details.
2. Validate your email address by clicking on the link in the validation email you received.
3. Wait until an administrator has approved your account (you will receive a confirmation email).

If second factor authentication is required you will be presented with a page like in the figure bellow. Scan the QR

After your account is created an administrator needs to validate your account before you can log in.
