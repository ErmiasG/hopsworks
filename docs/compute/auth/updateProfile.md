# Update your Profile and Credentials

After you have logged in, in the upper right-hand corner of the screen, you will see your name. Click on your name,
then click on the menu item **Account settings**. The User settings page will open with profile tab selected, from 
where you can change your first and last name. You cannot change your email address and will need to create a new 
account if you wish to change your email address. You can also log out by clicking on the **Log out** menu item.

## Enable/Reset Two-factor Authentication

You can also change your two-factor setting in the **Authentication** tab. Second factor authentication
is only available if it is enabled from the cluster administration page.

After enabling or resetting two-factor you will be presented with a QR Code. You will then need to scan the QR code 
to add it on your phone's authentication application. If you miss this step, you will have to recover your smartphone 
credentials at a later stage.
